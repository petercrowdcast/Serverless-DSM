~s nmserver problem:

Alex


nmserver is functioning on the following machines:
sela
obrien
troi
worf
tasha


Rebooting has solved this problem in the past.  All of these machines have
been up only a short time because of the OS change but...


Please write me back when your done as I need those machines to do another
test.

thanks, Peter
